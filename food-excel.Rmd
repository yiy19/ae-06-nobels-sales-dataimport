## Exercise 1

* Read in the Excel file called `favourite-food.xlsx` from the `data-raw/` folder.

```{r read-exce}
fav_food <- read_excel("data-raw/favourite-food.xlsx")
fav_food
```

* Clean up `NA`s and make sure you're happy with variable types.

```{r remove-na}
fav_food <- read_excel("data-raw/favourite-food.xlsx", na = c("N/A", "99999","five"))
fav_food 
```

* Convert SES (socio economic status) to a factor variables with levels in the 
following order: `Low`, `Middle`, `High`.

```{r as.factor}
fav_food$SES <- as.factor(fav_food$SES)
class(fav_food$SES)

fav_food <- fav_food %>% 
  mutate(SES = fct_relevel(SES, c("Low", "Middle", "High"
    
  )))

levels(fav_food$SES)
fav_food

```

* Write out the resulting data frame to `favourite-food.csv` in the `data/` folder.

```{r write-file}
write_csv(fav_food, "data/favorite-food.csv")
```

* Finally, read `favourite-food.csv` back in from the `data/` folder and 
observe the variable types. Are they as you left them? 

No.  

```{r reload-file}
fav_food <- read_csv("data/favorite-food.csv")
fav_food
```

## Exercise 2

* Read in the Excel file called `favourite-food.xlsx` from the `data-raw/` folder, 
taking care of `NA`s and variable types.

```{r label-me6, eval=FALSE}
fav_food <- read_excel(___, ___)
fav_food 
```

* Convert SES (socio economic status) to a factor variables with levels in the 
following order: `Low`, `Middle`, `High`.

```{r label-me7}
# add code here
```

* Write out the resulting data frame to `favourite-food.rds` in the `data/` folder.

```{r label-me8}
# add code here
```

* Read `favourite-food.rds` back in from the `data/` folder and observe the 
variable types. Are they as you left them?

```{r label-me9}
# add code here
```
